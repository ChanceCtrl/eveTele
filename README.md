## Shit don't work.
I know this and I am trying to make it work

## When will it work?
Fuck if I know, hopefully soon.

## How will it work?
It's gonna read a serial port for raw CAN messages and allow the user to create a widget to track the value of a given CAN packet over time. More or less acting as a wireless dash, for now...
